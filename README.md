Signal - A tailwind CSS minimal Ghost theme for tech writers.
=======================================================

This theme is based on the amazing [`Undefined` Starter Theme](https://github.com/curiositry/undefined-ghost-theme
) by [Curiosity](https://creativemarket.com/Curiositry).

## Features

- **TailwindCSS**. TailwindCSS is setup with PurgeCSS, using Laravel Mix.

- **Responsive!**. It's 2020...

- **Ready for Ghost v3 and beyond.** With undefined as a starting point, all Ghost 3 features like Members or Newsletter
 are ready supported. Some may not have been styled yet tho.

- **Super modular.** Undefined makes use of handlebar partials to break things into neat, self-contained modules. I
 left the BEM CSS classes from the starter theme, if you're into those. Although, [Utility First is definitely my
  prefered way
 ](https://frontstuff.io/in-defense-of-utility-first-css).

- **Cleanly coded and comprehensively commented**. The code is nice and clean. The theme scores "98" for mobile and 
"99" for desktop on Google Pagespeed.


- **Small assets**. There is currently no javascript for the theme and the single CSS file is under 10KB.

### TODO

- [ ] Make sure Newsletter feature is styled correctly
- [ ] Make sure Member feature is styled correctly
